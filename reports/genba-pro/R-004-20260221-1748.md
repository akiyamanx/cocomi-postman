### Claude Code Work Summary
## Summary

**Task:** Add a comment line to `CLAUDE.md`.

**Files created:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — New file created at project root with the line:
  `<!-- v2.1 精算書統合完了確認 2026-02-21 -->`

**Issues encountered:**
- The file did not previously exist in the repository. After confirming with the user, it was created as a new file.
- Tool errors occurred due to missing `ripgrep` binary and `/tmp` permission issues on the Android/Termux environment, but these did not block the task.

**Result:** Task completed successfully.
